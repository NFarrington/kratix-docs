We get asked “how does Kratix compare to technology X” in many of our conversations. In the platform space, Kratix overlaps with some, is very different to others and compliments many.

Rather than directly comparing Kratix to technologies in our space, we prefer to answer in terms of how Kratix works with, or compliments, other technologies.

Read on to understand how Kratix works with:

- [Terraform](./02-kratix-and-terraform.md)
- [Crossplane](./03-kratix-and-crossplane.md)
- Helm (TODO)
- [Backstage](./04-kratix-and-backstage.md)
