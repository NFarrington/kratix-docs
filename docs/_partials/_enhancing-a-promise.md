**In this tutorial, you will**
1. experience the power of leveraging customised Kratix Promises
1. gain confidence with the components of a Promise
1. enhance an sample Postgres Promise

## Using Kratix to support your organisation

As [you've seen](./installing-a-promise), Kratix can support Promises for services like Jenkins, Knative, and Postgres.

When you think about providing services for things like automation, deployment or data, how often are you able to choose a service (like Postgres) and offer it to your users straight off the shelf?

Probably not very often.

Application teams need to be able to easily run their services in different environments. They'll want specific sizes, particular backup strategies, defined versions, and more. Key stakeholders in other parts of the business also need to easily understand the state of service usage as it applies to them (hello audit, billing, and security!).

Your team works with all of these users to understand the if, when, and how of each of these requests and creates a platform from a prioritised backlog of platform features.

This platform needs to be extensible and flexible&mdash;your users will have new and changing needs, and you'll want to quickly respond to valuable feature requests.

Kratix and Promises make it easier to create a platform paved with golden paths that deliver value easily and quickly.

Now you will create and enhance a Promise as a response to user and business needs.

## From off-the-shelf to ready for the paved path

### The scenario

In this exercise, you and the platform team are starting development of the next platform feature.

You discussed needs with application teams and you've decided to offer a new service. You'll be adding Postgres to your platform.

The billing team is a key stakeholder for the platform, and they will need a cost centre for each new instance of your Postgres service to charge back to the right team.

For the purposes of this exercise, you know that all of the underlying functionality to get the billing team what it needs is already in place.

_In this guide, you only need create a new Postgres Promise that creates Postgres instances with a `costCentre` label._


**The steps:**

1. [Get a base Promise](#base-promise)
1. [Change the Promise so that _the user who wants an instance_ knows they need to include their `costCentre` name when they make their request to the platform](#xaas-crd)
1. [Change the Promise so that _the Worker Cluster_ Operator that creates the instance knows to apply your new `costCentre` label `costCentre`](#worker-cluster-resources)
1. [Change the Promise so that _the pipeline_ knows how to add the user's `costCentre` to the request for the instance](#xaas-request-pipeline)
1. [Install the modified Promise on your platform](#install-promise)
1. [Check it works: make a request to your platform for a Postgres instance](#verify-resource)


### Step one: Get a base Promise {#base-promise}

Kratix has a sample Postgres Promise. You'll use that as your base. Start by cloning the repository:

```console
git clone https://github.com/syntasso/kratix.git
```

Take a look
```console
cd kratix/samples/postgres/
ls
```

You should see the `postgres-promise.yaml` file. This is the Promise definition that you'll modify and install on your platform. Ignore everything else in the folder for now.

```

```

### Step two: `xaasCrd` {#xaas-crd}
> Change the Promise so that _the user who wants an instance_ knows they need to include their `costCentre` name when they make their request to the platform

#### About `xaasCrd`

<img
  align="right"
  src={useBaseUrl('/img/docs/xaasCrd.png')}
  alt="screenshot of a YAML file, highlighting the presence of the xaasCrd key"
/>

`xaasCrd` is the CRD exposed to the users of the [Promise](writing-a-promise). To see `xaasCrd` in the Promise definition file, open `postgres-promise.yaml` and look under the `spec` section.

`xaasCrd` is the contract with the user who wants an instance. It's where you get to define the required and optional configuration options exposed to your users.

You can already see a number of properties in this section of the `postgres-promise.yaml` file. These properties are defined within a versioned schema and can have different types and validations.

#### Update `xaasCrd`

To add the required cost centre configuration, add the following to the `postgres-promise.yaml`:

```yaml
costCentre:
  pattern: "^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]*$"
  type: string
```
From the top of the file, navigate to

`spec` > `xaasCrd` > `spec` > `versions`[0] > `schema` > <br /> `openAPIV3Schema` > `properties` > `spec` > `properties`

Here, add your `costCentre` YAML from above as a sibling to the existing `preparedDatabases` property.

</details>

### Step three: `workerClusterResources` {#worker-cluster-resources}

> Change the Promise so that _the Worker Cluster_ Operator that creates the instance knows to apply your new `costCentre` label `costCentre`

#### About `workerClusterResources`

<img
  align="right"
  src={useBaseUrl('/img/docs/workerClusterResources.png')}
  alt="screenshot of a YAML file, highlighting the presence of the workerClusterResources key"
/>

`workerClusterResources` is the description of all of the Kubernetes resources required to create an instance of the Promise, such as CRDs, Operators and Deployments.

In the Promise definition, you divide resources based on the idea of _prerequisite resources_ and _per-instance resources_. Prerequisite resources are resources that we create before any application team requests an instance. This can be helpful for two scenarios:
1. Any CRDs or dependency resources are ready when an instance is requested which speeds up response time to application teams.
1. Resources that can be shared across instances are only deployed once. This can reduce load on the cluster, and it can also allow defining a Kratix Resource Request as a portion of an existing resource (e.g. you could provide a whole database instance on each Resource Request, or you could provide a database within an existing instance on each Resource Request)

The `workerClusterResources` section of the Kratix Promise defines the _prerequisite capabilities_.

These capabilities are:
* created once per cluster.
* complete Kubernetes YAML documents stored in the `workerClusterResources` section of the Promise.

For the Postgres Promise you're defining, the only cluster resources (prerequisite capabilities) you need are conveniently packaged in a [Kubernetes Operator](https://github.com/zalando/postgres-operator) that is maintained by Zalando. The Operator turns the complexities of configuring Postgres into a manageable configuration format.

#### Update `workerClusterResources`

To make sure each Postgres instance includes `costCentre`, you need to make the Operator aware of the label.

To ensure Zalando's Postgres Operator is aware of the label, you need to add configuration when installing the Operator. The configuration the Operator needs will be under a new key: [`inherited_labels`](https://github.com/zalando/postgres-operator/blob/master/docs/reference/operator_parameters.md#kubernetes-resources?:=inherited_labels).


:::info

`inherited_labels` is unique to how Zalando's Postgres Operator works. If you were using a different Operator (or writing your own!), a different change may be required (or no change at all).

:::

Following the Zalando [`docs`](https://github.com/zalando/postgres-operator/blob/master/docs/reference/operator_parameters.md#kubernetes-resources?:=inherited_labels), you need to add `inherited_labels` in a particular spot.

From the top of the file, navigate to

`spec` > `workerClusterResources`[0] > `data`

To verify you're in the right place, the object should be `kind: ConfigMap` with `name: postgres-operator`.

Under the `data` map, add `inherited_labels: costCentre`.

### Step four: `xaasRequestPipeline` {#xaas-request-pipeline}
> Change the Promise so that _the pipeline_ knows how to add the user's `costCentre` to the request for the instance

#### About `xaasRequestPipeline`

<img
  align="right"
  src={useBaseUrl('img/docs/xaasRequestPipeline.png')}
  alt="Kratix logo"
/>

`xaasRequestPipeline` is the pipeline that will take your user's request, apply rules from your organisation (including adding the `costCentre` name), and output valid Kubernetes documents for the Operator to run on a Worker Cluster.

Conceptually, a pipeline is the manipulation of an input value to generate an output value. There are three parts to a Kratix Promise request pipeline.

* `minimal-postgres-manifest.yaml`
* `execute-pipeline.sh`
* `Dockerfile`


You can see these files in the `request-pipeline-image` directory. To connect the new user input label, we will need to make sure the pipelins both reads it in, and applies it to the right place in the customised resource outputs. This requires you to change two of files:

1. Resource template: This resource needs to hold reference to the `costCentre` _label_
1. Pipeline script: Inject the user's `costCentre` _actual value_ into the resource template to generate the output

#### Update the `minimal-postgres-manifest.yaml` to add in the property

The `minimal-postgres-manifest.yaml` is the pipeline basic template for the Postgres instance. This is a valid Kubernetes document that the Postgres Operator can understand.

You know every Postgres instance needs the `costCentre`. Change the metadata in `minimal-postgres-manifest.yaml` to include the `costCentre` label. This sets up a holding spot for the `costCentre` value the user sends in the request.

```yaml jsx title=kratix/samples/postgres/request-pipeline-image/minimal-postgres-manifest.yaml
labels:
  costCentre: TBD
```

<details>
<summary>👀&nbsp;&nbsp;Click here for the complete metadata section</summary>

```yaml jsx title=kratix/samples/postgres/request-pipeline-image/minimal-postgres-manifest.yaml
metadata:
  name: TBD
  namespace: default
  labels:
    costCentre: TBD
```
</details>

#### Update the `execute-pipeline.sh` to add in the user's value

The `execute-pipeline.sh` (in `kratix/samples/postgres/request-pipeline-image`) runs when Docker builds the image for the pipeline. This script is where the pipeline logic lives.

You can see that the script is already parsing the Kratix Resource Request to identify key user variables (`name`, `namespace`, `preparedDatabases`). The script then uses [yq](https://github.com/mikefarah/yq) to add those user-provided values to the output document. You can do the same to process the user's `costCentre`.

In the `execute-pipeline.sh`
1. Export another environment variable to store the value
    ```bash
    export COST_CENTRE=$(yq eval '.spec.costCentre' /input/object.yaml)
    ```
1. Add a new line for `yq` process the replacement as a part of the pipeline
    ```bash
    .metadata.labels.costCentre = env(COST_CENTRE) |
    ```

<details>
  <summary>👀&nbsp;&nbsp;Click here to view an example of the final script</summary>

```bash jsx title=kratix/samples/postgres/request-pipeline-image/execute-pipeline.sh
#!/bin/sh

set -x

# Store all input files in a known location
cp -r /tmp/transfer/* /input/

# Read current values from the provided Kratix Resource Request
export NAME=$(yq eval '.metadata.name' /input/object.yaml)
export NAMESPACE=$(yq eval '.metadata.namespace' /input/object.yaml)
export COST_CENTRE=$(yq eval '.spec.costCentre' /input/object.yaml)
export PREPARED_DBS=$(yq eval '.spec.preparedDatabases' /input/object.yaml)

# Replace defaults with user provided values
cat /input/minimal-postgres-manifest.yaml |  \
  yq eval '.metadata.name = env(NAME) |
          .metadata.namespace = env(NAMESPACE) |
          .metadata.labels.costCentre = env(COST_CENTRE) |
          .spec.preparedDatabases = env(PREPARED_DBS)' - \
  > /output/output.yaml
```
</details>

#### Test the pipeline locally

You can easily validate your pipeline locally by building and running the Docker image with the correct volume mounts.

Check that you are in the `kratix/samples/postgres` directory, and run the block below to:

1. create two directories inside `request-pipeline-image`: `input` and `output`
1. create expected input file (i.e., the request from your user)

```console
cd request-pipeline-image
mkdir -p {input,output}
cat > input/object.yaml <<EOF
---
apiVersion: example.promise.syntasso.io/v1
kind: postgres
metadata:
  name: acid-minimal-cluster
  namespace: default
spec:
  costCentre: "rnd-10002"
  preparedDatabases:
    mydb: {}
EOF
```

Now test the pipeline by doing a Docker build and run. _Check that, per the step above, you are still in the `request-pipeline-image` directory._

```console
docker build . --tag kratix-workshop/postgres-request-pipeline:dev
docker run -v ${PWD}/input:/input -v ${PWD}/output:/output kratix-workshop/postgres-request-pipeline:dev
```

Now you can validate the `output/output.yaml` file.

It should be the base manifest with all the custom values inserted and look like the example below. If your output is different, go back and check the steps from above and the files in the directory. Repeat this process until your output matches the output below.

<details>
    <summary>👀&nbsp;&nbsp;Click here to view an example of expected output YAML</summary>

```yaml jsx title="expected kratix/samples/postgres/request-pipeline-image/output/output.yaml"
apiVersion: "acid.zalan.do/v1"
kind: postgresql
metadata:
  name: acid-minimal-cluster
  namespace: default
  labels:
    costCentre: rnd-10002
spec:
  teamId: "acid"
  volume:
    size: 1Gi
  numberOfInstances: 2
  users:
    zalando: # database owner
      - superuser
      - createdb
    foo_user: [] # role for application foo
  databases:
    foo: zalando # dbname: owner
  preparedDatabases:
    mydb: {}
  postgresql:
    version: "13"
```
</details>

#### Give the platform access to your pipeline image

Once you have made and validated all the pipeline image changes, you will need to make the newly created `kratix-workshop/postgres-request-pipeline:dev` image accessible.

You have [installed Kratix across two KinD clusters](installing-kratix) as a prerequisite for the exercise. Because of that, you can take advantage of the fact that Kubernetes will always look for locally cached images first.

Load the image into local caches by running the command below. This will stop any remote DockerHub calls.

```console
kind load docker-image kratix-workshop/postgres-request-pipeline:dev --name platform
```

#### Update the Promise's `xaasRequestPipeline` value

The new image is built and available on your Platform Cluster. Update your Promise to use the new image.

Open the Promise definition file (`kratix/samples/postgres/postgres-promise.yaml`). From the top of the file, navigate to `spec` > `xaasRequestPipeline` and replace the current `syntasso/postgres-request-pipeline` image with the newly created `kratix-workshop/postgres-request-pipeline:dev` image.

<details>
  <summary>👀&nbsp;&nbsp;Click here to see the resulting xaasRequestPipeline section which should be indented under <code>spec</code> in the Promise yaml</summary>

```yaml jsx title="kratix/samples/postgres/postgres-promise.yaml"
apiVersion: platform.kratix.io/v1alpha1
kind: Promise
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: ha-postgres-promise
spec:
  xaasCrd:
  # ...
  xaasRequestPipeline:
  #highlight-next-line
  - kratix-workshop/postgres-request-pipeline:dev
  workerClusterResources:
  # ...
```
</details>

### Step five: Install {#install-promise}
> Install the modified Promise on your platform

You can now install your enhanced Postgres Promise on your platform. Make sure you're in the `kratix/samples/postgres/` directory.

```console
kubectl --context kind-platform apply --filename postgres-promise.yaml
```
<br />

Check that your Promise's resource is available.
```console
kubectl --context kind-platform get crds
```
<br />

You should see something similar to
```console
NAME                                          CREATED AT
clusters.platform.kratix.io                   2022-08-09T14:35:54Z
postgreses.example.promise.syntasso.io        2022-08-09T14:54:26Z
promises.platform.kratix.io                   2022-08-09T14:35:54Z
workplacements.platform.kratix.io             2022-08-09T14:35:54Z
works.platform.kratix.io                      2022-08-09T14:35:55Z
```
<br />

Check that the `workerClusterResources` have been installed.

For Postgres, you can see in the Promise file that there are a number of RBAC resources, as well as a deployment that installs the Postgres Operator in the Worker Cluster. That means that when the Promise is successfully applied you will see the `postgres-operator` deployment in the Worker Cluster. That's also an indication that the Operator is ready to provision a new instance.

```console
kubectl --context kind-worker --namespace default get pods
```
<br />

You should see something similar to
```console
NAME                                 READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
postgres-operator-6c6dbd4459-hcsg2   1/1     Running   0          1m
```
<br />

You have successfully released a new platform capability! Your users can request a Postgres instance, and that instance will include their `costCentre`.


### Step six: Verify {#verify-resource}
> Check it works: make a request to your platform for a Postgres instance

#### Verifying your Kratix Promise can be fulfiled

Switching hats to test your release, now act as one of your users to make sure the Promise creates working instances.

You need to create a Kratix Resource Request, which is a valid Kubernetes resource. Like all Kubernetes resources, this  must include all [required fields](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/kubernetes-objects/#required-fields):

1. `apiVersion` where the resource can be found. This is `example.promise.syntasso.io/v1` in your Postgres Promise (from `spec.xaasCrd.spec.group` in `postgres-promise.yaml`).
1. `kind`. This is `postgres` in your Postgres Promise (from `spec.xaasCrd.spec.name` in `postgres-promise.yaml`).
1. Values for required fields. Fields are `preparedDatabases` and `costCentre` in your Postgres Promise (from `spec` > `xaasCrd` > `spec` > `versions`[0] > `schema` > `openAPIV3Schema` > `properties` > `spec` > `properties` in `postgres-promise.yaml`).
1. A unique name and namespace combination.

In the sample Resource Request (`kratix/samples/postgres/postgres-resource-request.yaml`) add the additional `costCentre` field as a sibling to the `preparedDatabases` field with any valid input. For example, `costCentre: "rnd-10002"`.

<details>
<summary>👀&nbsp;&nbsp;Click here for the full Postgres Resource Request</summary>

```yaml jsx title="kratix/samples/postgres/postgres-resource-request.yaml"
apiVersion: example.promise.syntasso.io/v1
kind: postgres
metadata:
  name: acid-minimal-cluster
  namespace: default
spec:
  costCentre: "rnd-10002"
  preparedDatabases:
    mydb: {}
```
</details>

Then apply the request file to the Platform Cluster:

```console
kubectl --context kind-platform apply --filename postgres-resource-request.yaml
```

We will validate the outcomes of this command in the next section.

#### Validating the created Postgres

Back as a platform engineer, you want to ensure that the platform and Promise behaved as it should when creating the instances and that the instances have met the reequirements for the feature.

After you applied the Kratix Resource Request in the step above, you should eventually see a new pod executing the `request-pipeline-image/execute-pipeline.sh` script you created.

<p>Check by listing the pods on the platform:<br />
<sub>(This may take a few minutes so <code>--watch</code> will watch the command. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop watching)</sub>
</p>

```console
kubectl --context kind-platform get pods --watch
```

You should see something similar to
```console
NAME                                                     READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
request-pipeline-ha-postgres-promise-default-<SHA>       0/1     Completed   0          1h
```

Then view the pipeline logs by running _(replace SHA with the value from the output of `get pods` above)_:

```console
kubectl --context kind-platform logs --container xaas-request-pipeline-stage-1 pods/request-pipeline-ha-postgres-promise-default-<SHA>
```

<p>On the Worker Cluster, you will eventually see a Postgres service as a two-pod cluster in the <em>Running</em> state with the name defined in the request (<code>postgres-resource-request.yaml</code>).<br />
<sub>(This may take a few minutes so <code>--watch</code> will watch the command. Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop watching)</sub>
</p>

```console
kubectl --context kind-worker get pods --watch
```

You should see something similar to

For the finance team, the pods will provide cost tracking through your new `costCentre` label. This can be confirmed by only selecting pods that contain the provided cost centre value:

```console
kubectl --context kind-worker get pods --selector costCentre=rnd-10002
```

You should see something similar to
```
NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
acid-minimal-cluster-0   1/1     Running   0          1h
acid-minimal-cluster-1   1/1     Running   0          1h
```

## Summary
Your platform has a new Promise. Your users have access to a new service from the Promise. Your finance team has the ability to track service usage. Well done!

To recap the steps we took:
1. ✅&nbsp;&nbsp;Aquired a base Promise
1. ✅&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed the Promise so that _the user who wants an instance_ knows they need to include their `costCentre` name when they make their request to the platform
1. ✅&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed the Promise so that _the Worker Cluster_ Operator that creates the instance knows to apply the new `costCentre` label `costCentre`
1. ✅&nbsp;&nbsp;Changed the Promise so that _the pipeline_ knows how to add the user's `costCentre` to the request for the instance
1. ✅&nbsp;&nbsp;Installed the modified Promise on your platform
1. ✅&nbsp;&nbsp;Checked it works: make a request to your platform for a Postgres instance

## Cleanup environment {#cleanup}
To clean up your environment first delete the Resource Requests for the Postgres instance

```bash
kubectl --context kind-platform delete --filename postgres-resource-request.yaml
```

Verify the resources belonging to the Resource Requests have been deleted in the Worker Cluster
```console
kubectl --context kind-worker get pods
```

Now the Resource Requests have been deleted you can delete the Promise
```bash
kubectl --context kind-platform delete --filename postgres-promise.yaml
```

Verify the Worker Cluster Resources are deleted from the Worker Cluster
```console
kubectl --context kind-worker get pods
```
