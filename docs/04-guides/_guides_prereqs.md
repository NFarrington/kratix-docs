You need a fresh installation of Kratix for this section. The simplest way to do so is by running the quick-start script from within the Kratix directory.

```bash
./scripts/quick-start.sh --recreate
```

Alternatively, you can go back to [Installing Kratix](../category/installing-kratix) and follow the appropriate guide.

:::note

The remaining of this guide will assume you have a [multi-cluster setup with KinD](installing-kratix/multi-cluster-with-kind). If you are using a different setup, you will need to adapt the commands accordingly.
